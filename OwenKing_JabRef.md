# Pay Station

## Project Abstract

JabRef is an open source project that makes it easier to collect and use bibliography data from online sites that you visit, making them easy to cite and link articles that you have come across.  It has many features to keep your database of sources clean and free of duplicates, and organized into groups based on keyword or tags.  It also allows for attachment of related documents to elements, so you can store more than just the articles themselves.  Also, for working in teams you can sync the contents of your personal library to a group one in a SQL database.  This data can be integrated into LaTeX papers, and would greatly simplify the complicated formatting required in such documents.

## Project Relevance
This project uses many topics from the list included. Currently it has many outstanding issues available for debugging.  Looking at the issues that are completed or currently raised, it appears that code profiling and optimization could be utilized as well.  The application itself does not run print out prompts in the command line, and has an executable that uses a GUI that we can update and learn from.  As said above,  group projects can be synced in a SQL database as well.  The project has many open issues that it tracks, and requires branching to create new updates under.  Therefore, this project covers the following educational goals:

- Debugging
- Code profiling and optimization
- Graphic User Interface
- Access to Database
- Version Control
- Build
- Test
- Issue Tracking
- Github project


## Conceptual Design
Since this project has about 200 open issues there are many things that we could potentially offer to help them with.  It has a good first issue tag to work on issues as a way to get familiar with the project that would be a good starting point.  After this, we could work on many of the other potential issues, such as cleanup, duplicateFinder, export functionality, or search history functionality, which has yet to be implemented and are under the good first issue label.  Overall, there are an abundance of issues to potentially be worked on, with over 2,500 issues closed, this project is continually being worked on, has lots of support, and would be a good project to contribute to.
