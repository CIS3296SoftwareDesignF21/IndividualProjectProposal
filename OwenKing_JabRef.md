# Pay Station

## Project Abstract

JabRef is an open source project that makes it easier to collect and use bibliography data from online sites that you visit, making them easy to cite and link articles that you have come across.  It has many features to keep your database of sources clean and free of duplicates, and organized into groups based on keyword or tags.  It also allows for attachment of related documents to elements, so you can store more than just the articles themselves.  Also, for working in teams you can sync the contents of your personal library to a group one in a SQL database.

## Project Relevance
This project uses many topics from the list included. Currently it has many outstanding issues, so Debugging is on the table.  Looking at the issues that are completed or currently raised, it appears that Code profiling and optimization is involved as well.  The application itself does not run print out prompts in the command line, and has an executable that has a Graphic User Interface to make use easy.  As said above,  group projects can be synced in a SQL database as well.  The project has many open issues that it tracks, branching to work on these issues and maintain multiple versions.

## Conceptual Design
Since this project has about 200 open issues there are many things that we could potentially offer to help them with.  It has a good first issue tag to work on issues as a way to get familiar with the project that would be a good starting point.  After this, we could work on many of the other potential issues, such as cleanup, duplicateFinder, export functionality, or search history functionality, which has yet to be implemented.  Overall, there are an abundance of issues to potentially be worked on, with over 2,500 issues closed, this project is continually being worked on, and I could easily see myself using it as well.
